# TECDEM - Tool for Efficient CityGML District Energy Modelling

This is the Tool for Efficient CityGML District Energy Modelling (TECDEM). It is a Python-based tool that utilizes CityGML, the [EnergyADE](https://www.citygmlwiki.org/images/4/41/KIT-UML-Diagramme-Profil.pdf), and the [Districtgenerator](https://github.com/RWTH-EBC/districtgenerator) (also known as Quartiersgenerator) to easily parameterize districts based on CityGML files and save the data as CityGML.

The tool can be used for quickly analyzing districts. We consider such tools relevant, as districts provide an important scale in the energy transition. They offer more flexibility than a single building and hence can be considered the smallest cell of energy transition.

## Project Status

TECDEM is currently under heavy development. While there are no specific features to highlight at this time, all current functionalities are showcased in the experiments provided.

## Installation

To install TECDEM, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository
2. Run: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Navigate to the `src` folder and clone this branch of the [Districtgenerator](https://github.com/c0nb4/districtgenerator)

For a complete list of dependencies, please refer to the `requirements.txt` file in the repository.

## Usage

Please refer to the experiments in the repository for examples of how to use TECDEM.
