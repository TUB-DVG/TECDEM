# TECDEM - Tool for Efficient CityGML District Energy Modelling

This is the Tool for Efficient CityGML District Energy Modelling (TECDM). It is a python based tool that is utilizing CityGML, the [EnergyADE](https://www.citygmlwiki.org/images/4/41/KIT-UML-Diagramme-Profil.pdf) and the [Districtgenerator](https://github.com/RWTH-EBC/districtgenerator) (also known as Quartiersgenerator) to easily parameterize districts based on CityGML files and save the data as CityGML. 


The tools can be used for quickly analyzing districts. We consider such tools relevant, as districs provide an important scale in the energy transition. They provide more flexibility than a single building an hence can be considered the smallest cell of energy transition. 



## Installation

For installation, clone this repo and run: 

'' pip install requirements.txt ''

Then got to the src folder and clone this branch of the [Districtgenerator](https://github.com/c0nb4/districtgenerator)
